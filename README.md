# -Data-Collection-Individual-Aggregated-Study-Hours
## Overview
Have you ever wondered how you actually spend your day? Or how your study habits compare to those of your peers?

This project explores personalized and class-wide study data collected by students enrolled in QMM7301: Statistics for Data Analytics from Fall 2019 to Fall 2022. The aim is to analyze patterns in study behavior using R and R Markdown, and to investigate relationships between study time and different program streams.

## Case Study Objectives
Using the provided personalized and class data sets, this analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

Do average study times differ among students from different analytics program streams (BAPG, CAGC, HAGC)?

Is the distribution of days with study hours exceeding 3.13 (McGill's average) independent of the program stream?

How does my personal study time change over the semester?

## Dataset Description
The data set includes the following variables:

Date: The day data was collected

Hours: Number of hours spent studying

Semester: Academic term (e.g., F19, W20, F21, W22, S22, or F22)

Program: Student's program stream (BAPG, CAGC, or HAGC)
